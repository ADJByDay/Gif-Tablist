# Gif-Tablist
A script to convert a video to a minecraft java server tablist!

This script will take any input of a video in any of the formats compatible with Python OpenCV (cv2).
The output will be a large json file to animate a tablist with the contents of the video in 80x45 resoloution.

The output is not the most space efficcient and I would reccomend only short videos, maximum of 1 minute.
Loading one of these will cause increased CPU and RAM use on the server.

I have only tested with Styled Player List on a fabric 1.21.8 server. It may be compatible with other server mods but I do not know.

Styled Player List is available here: https://modrinth.com/mod/styledplayerlist
